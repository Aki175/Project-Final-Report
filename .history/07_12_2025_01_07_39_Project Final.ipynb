Here we see the most players with 0 playtime, as well as that small contingent of highly dedicated players with up to 150+ hours of playtime. Older players tend to be clustered into lower playtimes, presumably due to busier schedules, lower interest, or perhaps due to the aforementioned small sample size.

    "The medians for all experience levels are remarkably similar to each other, with all of them laying around 20 years. If experience level were directly tied to age there would likely be a more noticeable trend. Though the median for the pro tier, the highest experience level, is slightly lower, it's not significantly lower than the rest of the levels. Additionally, the greatest outliers are actually in the amateur and regular tiers. Skill and level progression are likely not directly to age. Perhaps this is tied to specific in-game Minecraft mechanics. However, we will take a closer look with a K-NN classification model later on in our analysis."

    "This bar graph helps visualize the number of players at every experience level, and from this we can see that the experience level with the most amount of players is 'Amateur', while 'Pro' is the experience level with the least amount of players. Additionally, there is a very similar amount of Beginners and Regulars, with a slightly larger amount of Veterans. From this, we can see that the majority of players fall around the amateur level, with more players being closer to a Regular or Beginner level compared to a Pro level. Comparing this with our previous plot, Figure 5, we see that despite there being a difference in number of players at each experience level, their relative ages are around the same, of course with more outliers occuring in the levels with more players, such as in the 'Amateur' level."

    "* We are assuming that data collected from the PLAICraft server is representative of the player base we will analyze, and that the sample of 196 players accurately reflects the entire population of interest.\n",
    "* Each player and their respective data in the players.csv dataset is unique and independent of other players, and each player's age or experience level is not statistically dependent on any other player.\n",
    "* All values within the dataset are recorded accurately, and excluding any NAs, the rest of the recorded data is accurate and not manipulated in any way.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Linear Regression Assumptions:\n",
    "* We are assuming that there is a linear relationship between Age (the predictor) and played_hours (the outcome)\n",
    "* assuming that any outliers or residuals are evenly distributed throughout the time_played data, and that doing a log transformation (as our data is right-skewed) will help highlight the normality of the data, and that the aforementioned residuals are distributed evenly across all age groups (one or a select few age groups don't have all of the residuals or outliers)\n",
    "\n",
    "#####  Missing Data Values (and zeros) Assumptions:\n",
    "* As previously mentioned, any NAs, specifically found in the Age of players can be excluded and removed from the data without any significant impact on the overall trends, as these NAs are sparse and shouldn't lead to any unfairness.\n",
    "* We are assuming that players with played_hours of 0.0 are valid, as they likely joined the research but never played. By transforming the value in our linear regression through a log transformation (log(played_hours + 1)) , these values of 0.0 won't impact the data drastically."
