    "There's no strong relationship between playtime and age, as there's a high degree of variability in playtime for all ages. In addition, a line of fit would be a biased here given the lack of older players. Younger players (10-25 years old) have the widest diversity of total playtime. Here we see the most players with 0 playtime, as well as that small contingent of highly dedicated players with up to 150+ hours of playtime. Older players tend to be clustered into lower playtimes, presumably due to busier schedules, lower interest, or perhaps due to the aforementioned small sample size. There is however one single outlier, a 49 year old player with over 18 hours of playtime, far more than most players, even those in the younger demographic.\n",
    "There does not appear to be strong correlation between age and subscription, but subscription and playtime may be connected.

    "The vast majority of registered players did not rack up any amount of time on the server. Therefor, the majority of registered users either haven't played on the server or have spent such an insignificant amount of time on the server that their time played has rounded down to 0. Many users register but do not meaningfully play or interact with the server. This confirms our initial thought, it shows the distribution of play hours is highly right skewed. This supports the need to consider possible transformations like log for example in later analysis.\n",

This spans from about log .8 to log 2.5 (anywhere from 6 minutes to 5 hours on the server). Most players who have actually interacted with the server still show low-moderate playtime. The tail of the graph showcases small numbers of highly dedicated players, ranging from log 3-4 (anywhere from 15-150+ hours). There's a very small but very dedicated playerbase, leading to a small but long tail in the data.\n"

    "##### General Assumptions About Our Data:\n",
    "* We are assuming that data collected from the PLAICraft server is representative of the player base we will analyze, and that the sample of 196 players accurately reflects the entire population of interest.\n",
    "* Each player and their respective data in the players.csv dataset is unique and independent of other players, and each player's age or experience level is not statistically dependent on any other player.\n",

    "* We are assuming that there is a linear relationship between Age (the predictor) and played_hours (the outcome)\n",
    "* assuming that any outliers or residuals are evenly distributed throughout the time_played data, and that doing a log transformation (as our data is right-skewed) will help highlight the normality of the data, and that the aforementioned residuals are distributed evenly across all age groups (one or a select few age groups don't have all of the residuals or outliers)\n",
    "\n",
    "#####  Missing Data Values (and zeros) Assumptions:\n",
    "* As previously mentioned, any NAs, specifically found in the Age of players can be excluded and removed from the data without any significant impact on the overall trends, as these NAs are sparse and shouldn't lead to any unfairness.\n",
    "* We are assuming that players with played_hours of 0.0 are valid, as they likely joined the research but never played. By transforming the value in our linear regression through a log transformation (log(played_hours + 1)) , these values of 0.0 won't impact the data drastically."
